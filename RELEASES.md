## Releases

# Unreleased

# Version 0.1.0 (2019-11-14)

This marks the first release of the project. The essential features that users
need to create applications such as key generation, script building, and block
synchronization are implemented.

### Known limitations

The script engine isn't implemented so transactions and full block validation
cannot be performed. However, block headers can be validated.
